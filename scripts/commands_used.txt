RNA-seq Workflow Summary (Windows Command-Line Execution)

1. Quality Control
   Raw FASTQ files were assessed using FastQC to evaluate sequencing quality and adapter contamination.

2. Read Trimming
   Trimmomatic (single-end mode) was used for adapter removal and quality filtering using sliding window and minimum length parameters.

3. Alignment
   Quality-filtered reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using HISAT2.

4. Gene-level Quantification
   featureCounts was used to generate gene-level read count matrices from aligned reads.

5. Differential Expression Analysis
   DESeq2 (R) was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between infected and control samples.

6. Visualization
   Volcano plots and heatmaps were generated to interpret expression patterns.
